## Explore Bikeshare Data
This project is the first one in the series of projects in DAND. We explore US bike share data from three different cities. <br>
We try to answer some questions regarding the usage of bikes, characteristics of users and type of trips duration.<br>
This project being the first one in the course, it uses native python way of handling data. Meaning without using pandas or numpy which at this point in the course has not been introduced.
